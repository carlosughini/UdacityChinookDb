Question 1: Which countries have the most Invoices?
Use the Invoice table to determine the countries that have the most invoices. Provide a table of BillingCountry and Invoices ordered by the number of invoices for each country. The country with the most invoices should appear first.

/* Query 1 - query used for first insight */
SELECT Customer.Country, COUNT(Invoice.InvoiceId) AS Invoices
FROM Invoice
JOIN Customer 
ON Invoice.CustomerID = Customer.CustomerID
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Question 2: Which city has the best customers?
We would like to throw a promotional Music Festival in the city we made the most money. Write a query that returns the 1 city that has the highest sum of invoice totals. Return both the city name and the sum of all invoice totals.

/* Query 2 - query used for second insight */
SELECT customer.city, SUM(invoice.Total) AS "Invoice Totals"
FROM customer
JOIN invoice 
ON customer.CustomerId=Invoice.CustomerId
GROUP BY customer.city
ORDER BY sum(invoice.Total) DESC
LIMIT 10;

Question 3: Who is the best customer?
The customer who has spent the most money will be declared the best customer. Build a query that returns the person who has spent the most money. I found the solution by linking the following three: Invoice, InvoiceLine, and Customer tables to retrieve this information, but you can probably do it with fewer!

/* Query 3 - query used for third insight */
SELECT  FirstName || ' ' || LastName as Name, sum(i.Total) as TotalSpent
FROM Customer c
JOIN invoice i 
ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
GROUP BY (i.CustomerId)
ORDER BY TotalSpent desc
LIMIT 10;


/* Query 4 - query used for fourth insight */
SELECT Artist.Name, SUM(InvoiceLine.UnitPrice) as "Unit Price"
FROM InvoiceLine
JOIN Track 
ON Track.TrackId = InvoiceLine.TrackId
JOIN Album 
ON Album.AlbumId = Track.AlbumId
JOIN Artist 
ON Artist.ArtistId = Album.ArtistId
GROUP BY Artist.Name
ORDER BY 2 desc
LIMIT 15;
